Genetic Expression Generator
============================

GEG (Genetic Expression Generator) is a tool used to generate expressions that equate to an arbitrarily inputted integer.

One of the most useful cases for such a tool is for obfuscation routines. However, this tool was mainly created in order to learn concepts in Genetic Algorithms.

A huge thanks to [ai-junkie](http://www.ai-junkie.com/ga/intro/gat1.html) for writing an amazing tutorial on genetic algorithms, in general. :)
