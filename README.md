Genetic Expression Generator
============================

GEG (Genetic Expression Generator) is a tool used to generate expressions that equate to an arbitrarily inputted integer.

One of the most useful cases for such a tool is for obfuscation routines. However, this tool was mainly created in order to learn concepts in Genetic Algorithms.

A huge thanks to [ai-junkie](http://www.ai-junkie.com/ga/intro/gat1.html) for writing an amazing tutorial on genetic algorithms, and to [yati-sagade](https://github.com/yati-sagade/exprolution/) for introducing me to the ai-junkie tutorial. :)

Usage
-----

Run the code using `python geg.py`
